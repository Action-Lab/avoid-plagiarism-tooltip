    <strong>Original source:</strong> The American, probably more than any other man, is prone to be apologetic about the trade he follows. He seldom believes that it is quite worthy of his virtues and talents; almost always he thinks that he would have adorned something far gaudier. Unfortunately, it is not always possible for him to escape, or even for him to dream plausibly of escaping, so he soothes himself by assuring himself that he belongs to a superior section of his craft, and very often he invents a sonorous name to set himself off from the herd. Here we glimpse the origin of a multitude of characteristic American euphemisms, e.g., mortician for undertaker, realtor for real-estate agent, electragist for electrical contractor ... so on (Mencken 284).

      <strong>Author 3:</strong> Mencken explains the origin of these professional euphemisms as lying in the American’s vanity; the American feels that he is really better than his profession, but since he cannot escape it, he tries to make it at least sound worthy of him (284).<br><span title='Acceptable.
